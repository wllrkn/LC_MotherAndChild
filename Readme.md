# Notes
This is a test mod which permasets the sprint modifier to 1.
This is will eventually become my mother and child mod for Lethal Company. 

# Idea description
Had an idea in the shower of a lethal company enemy
Two mobs: a crying baby/lost child and a mother
If you find the crying baby, and manage to sell it, big £££
However the mother is trying to find it, and will kill you if she finds you with it
If you pick the baby up it cries louder so mum can hear it easier
